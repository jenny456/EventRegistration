      It’s true that being a specialist in one’s field and gaining mastery of a particular aspect of
       technology has distinct advantages, but as technology rapidly expands and evolves,
        industries are constantly changing. With this change comes the need for skills branching
        out to multiple technologies and the ability to
       build end to end products to potentially transform the way people live around the world!
    </p>
    <p >
      With that said, HackerEarth presents StackHack 1.0, inviting all developers and hackathon enthusiasts
       to come up with fantastic ideas to build minimal viable products from scratch.
       Code your way from the backend to the frontend and design products to inspire!
    </p>
    <p >
      This hackathon is open to all developers who have an eye for design and passion for code.
       Participants can either hack individually or as a team of four. Take advantage of
      this opportunity to learn with other teams, showcase your talent, and compete for prizes!
